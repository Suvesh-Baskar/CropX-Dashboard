# Dashboard for a IoT Project

The project here is a web application that can be used to monitor different sensor and actuator parameters of an IoT based Smart Irrigation Project. The application has an API through which it receives data and stores the data in a local database. The frontend receives data through get requests from server. The pages are refreshed automatically after certain timeinterval so users will be shown with the recent status of the IoT application.
